Oh hello there! I see you're looking for your birthday cake! I know, I know,  you are excited to get your cake back.
But before you go, you need to follow some basic guidlines:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Your character (D), when moving, will be shown as arrows to indicate directions of walking (^>v<).
2. Most objects and items can trigger dialogues by pressing <SpaceBar>, you may want to explore the whole map.
3. To select items or continue conversations in-game, press <Enter>
4. Due to the fact that certain parts of the program were written months ago, Setpos(i,j) was not used.
     i.e. for laptop cake chasers the game may be a little laggy.
5. Due to the fact that the programmer doesn't even know how to make a decent program, this game may be buggy.
6. Should you have any inquiries, please contact Gele the Matey, he may be a pirate but he certainly knows about 
     this game. And of course you can find me the you know who too.
